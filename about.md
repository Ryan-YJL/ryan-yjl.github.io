<p>This is my personal site where I post about <a href="/category/web/">web technologies</a> &mdash; generally known as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2014/04/11/full-stack-developer-is-a-tall-order-bordering-on-unicorn-territory/">full stack development</a> and pretty much <a href="/category/everything/">everything else</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from dabbling in new web technologies, I was involved in my startup development.</p>

<p>My portfolio are currently <u>on hold</u> in prototype state. If you are interested, here are <a href="/portfolio/">some of the stuff I was up to</a>.</p>

<p>While developing my startup ideas, I created <a href="https://www.setcron.com">SetCron</a>, a web cron utility. I am an active user and occasional contributor of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com">github</a>. I have also contributed plugins to <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelors in Business from <a href="http://www.nbs.ntu.edu.sg">Nanyang Business School</a>, NTU, specializing in Banking &amp; Finance. Before working on my startup, I was a adjunct lecturer at <a href="http://www.ite.edu.sg">ITE</a>, College West teaching students on website creation &amp; business writing. </p>
